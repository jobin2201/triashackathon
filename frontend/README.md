# Frontend Setup and Running Guide

## Overview

This guide provides the necessary steps to set up and run the **Frontend** for the **Medications Management System**. The frontend is built using **Angular** and communicates with the backend to manage and display medication data, track schedules, and provide an interactive user interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running the frontend, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: The frontend is built using Node.js and Angular. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node Package Manager (npm) is used to manage dependencies, and it comes bundled with Node.js.
- **Angular CLI**: The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is required for building and running Angular applications. Install it globally by running:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
